# Hell-in-Space

Submission for Github's Game Off 2018.

Hell in Space is a 2-D Bullet hell space shooter, where the player (that's you) controls one of the deadliest vechiles in space, the Starfighter, against a relentless horde of enemy spacecraft. 

Starfighter is a hybrid spaceship, and relies on solar power to defend itself, which for any normal spaceship is plenty.

Unfortunately, Starfighter packs a punch, and all it's high-tech equipment sure drains that energy quickly, leaving you defenseless.

Nevertheless, you forge on, with your only chance of survival being to downgrade your weapons and abilities so that your energy never depletes.
